"""
splitting.py — Train / validation / test split utilities (student-implementable).

``split_data`` receives the label array ``y`` and, optionally, the full
DataFrame ``df`` (for group-aware splits).  It must return a list of
``(idx_train, idx_val, idx_test)`` tuples of integer index arrays.

Contract
--------
* ``idx_train``, ``idx_val``, ``idx_test`` are 1-D NumPy arrays of integer
  indices into the full dataset.
* ``idx_val`` may be ``None`` if no separate validation fold is needed.
* All indices must be non-overlapping; together they must cover every sample.
* Return a **list** — one element for a single split, K elements for k-fold.
